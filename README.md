# Good Practices Bioinfo2018

A 4-hour course on (what we think are) good practices in bioinformatics.

## Objectives of the course

For the trainee:
* Where to find resources.
* Guidance to a **more efficient** use of the CRG resources.
* Introduction to specific terminology.

For the trainers:
* Collect feedback on all topics:
* What else is needed on the trainee side?
* Organization of future hands on sessions based on trainees needs and interests.
